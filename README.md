## Smart Home System

This project is an example of a **Smart Home System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The system allows users to control various devices within a home, such as lights, thermostats, and security cameras, all through a central interface. 

### Key Features:
- **Device Management:** Users can add, remove, and control devices such as lights, alarms, and temperature settings.
- **Automation:** Set rules for automatic actions based on time of day, sensor data, or user preferences.
- **Security:** Monitor and control security devices like cameras and alarms remotely.
- **User Profiles:** Multiple users can set personalized preferences and access control.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python** (or your preferred programming language)
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **GUI Library** (if you used a graphical user interface)
- **Database** (if any, for user and device data storage)

### How it Works:
- The system is designed using **classes** and **objects**, allowing for a modular and scalable structure. 
- Each device is represented as an object with properties and methods for controlling it. 
- A **central controller** manages the interactions between devices and users, ensuring the system runs smoothly.
